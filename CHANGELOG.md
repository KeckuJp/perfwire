# Changelog

## [0.6.12] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Public-launch readiness**: repository preparation for publishing under the KeckuJp GitHub
  organization. `README.md` restructured (problem statement and a Mermaid agent↔human loop
  diagram moved up front, ERC/EE findings pulled into a scannable "What it checks before you
  solder" table, install/troubleshooting detail collapsed into `<details>`) with a first
  translation, `README.ja.md`, cross-linked via a language switcher at the top of both files
  (more languages planned; see `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s translation guide).
- **`SAFETY.md`**: states plainly that the ERC/`fabReady` audit is advisory, not a safety
  certification, and calls out hazards the audit doesn't model (mains wiring, Li-ion charging).
- **Feedback mechanism**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` gained three structured forms (bug report,
  ERC/audit verdict dispute — a first-class category given the deterministic-audit design, and
  feature request) plus `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The bundled skill (`.claude/skills/perfwire/SKILL.md`)
  now documents a conversational flow for filing one of these on a user's behalf when they
  report a problem or request — draft first, get explicit approval before `gh issue create`,
  never file silently, with a non-`gh` fallback and guidance on redacting local paths/board data
  before anything is shared.
- **`tools/check_manifests.mjs`** gained a lightweight structural check that `README.md` and
  `README.ja.md` cross-link each other and that the Japanese translation carries a `SYNC:`
  marker — existence and linkage only, not a content-sync requirement (translations are allowed
  to lag by design).

## [0.6.11] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **WebGL orbit 3D view.** A new, dependency-free WebGL renderer replaces the fixed-angle
  Canvas 2D isometric view as the primary "3D" toggle: drag to orbit freely (any yaw, pitch
  clamped 20°–85° to avoid gimbal lock), wheel to zoom, click to select (synced with the 2D
  editor's selection state), 90°-snap rotation button retained. Falls back silently to the
  existing Canvas 2D isometric view if WebGL context creation fails (old hardware, disabled
  software rendering) — that code path is unchanged and untouched.
- **Realistic per-part geometry.** All 5 built-in kinds (elec/disc/film/r/ic) get bent leads
  from a body-side socket to their board hole plus a solder fillet at the hole, instead of a
  bare box with straight vertical stubs — the single biggest fix for parts reading as "shapes
  floating over the board" rather than "components soldered to it." A generic fallback
  (`gl3dMeshGeneric`) applies the same lead-forming/fillet treatment to any part kind outside
  the 5 built-ins, so a future new kind never regresses to a disconnected-looking box.
- **Wire obstacle clearance.** A wire's rendered arc height now rises to clear any part it
  passes over (derived from that part's true rendered top height, including kinds using the
  package system below), instead of visually piercing through it. The wire's horizontal path
  is unchanged — only the height of the existing parabolic arc is affected — so it still
  matches the 2D routing plan exactly.
- **Package/shape appearance channel** (`part.pkg` / `part.phys3d`, optional, visual-only —
  read only by the 3D view, never by `solver.py` or ERC). Naming a known package token
  (`to92`/`to220`/`led3`/`led5`/`do41`/`tact6`/`header254`/`trimpot3386`/`buzzer12`) draws a
  part in its real silhouette (TO-92's standing cylinder, TO-220's heatsink tab, an LED's
  dome, a pin header's individual pins, etc.) instead of settling for a generic box; a
  per-instance `phys3d` override (`shape`/dimensions/`color`/`source`/`confidence`) covers
  parts with no matching standard package. Design and data-provenance discipline mirror the
  existing `config.physical` convention (cite a source, flag an estimate honestly) — see
  `.claude/skills/perfwire/SKILL.md` for the full field reference and the resolution ladder
  for agents populating it. A part with `confidence:"estimate"`/`"todo"` shows a standing
  "visual dimensions are an estimate" disclosure in the 3D status bar while selected.
- **Focus+context decluttering for dense boards.** Hovering or click-pinning a net (new,
  3D-view-only) ghosts (opaque desaturation) unrelated wires and parts so the board stays
  readable once part/wire counts climb; wire-body hover detection (not just hole-adjacent
  hover) was added alongside it.

### Fixed
- Several issues surfaced by headless-Chrome verification and adversarial review during this
  feature's development, before they could ship as regressions: a command-palette rotation
  action that crashed while the WebGL view was open; a 90°-snap-rotate stack that could
  reverse direction on rapid repeated presses; a stale geometry-cache key that could leave
  meshes at the wrong scale after a config reload; and a genuinely dead `Escape`-key code path
  (an existing, unrelated `if(ISO.on)` check always ran first and returned, since WebGL
  success also sets that flag — folded the fix into the existing branch instead of adding an
  unreachable sibling one).
- `tools/ci_smoke.py` gained a regression lock asserting that a part carrying `pkg`/`phys3d`
  survives `solver.py`'s round-trip with those fields byte-identical — the case the whole
  appearance channel depends on.

## [0.6.10] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Drag→undo could desync the editor from what was actually drawn.** `snap()` (the undo-checkpoint push) ran *after* a drag's mutation instead of before it in one code path, so `Ctrl+Z` could restore a stale board while the visible SVG kept the just-dragged position — and a specific drag sequence could register as a false "revert" that silently duplicated a part. Fixed the snapshot timing and the duplicate-detection check that depended on it.
- **A brand-new standalone board (no starter proposal) had no way to reach a power-connected, auditable state.** Adding parts one at a time from a blank board could leave a net with no path to a supply/ground rail and no UI action to fix it — a beginner following the guide hit a dead end. Added a UI entry point (also reachable from the audit panel's own NG-fix suggestions) to place an external power/ground terminal directly on the board.
- **`importObj()` (paste/upload a board JSON) crashed uncaught on a structurally malformed part** (e.g. an IC missing `pins`) and wedged the board for the rest of the session — every subsequent `render()` call (any mouse move, any mode switch) hit the same exception again, with no error toast telling the user what happened. It also gave no feedback at all on a successful import, and JSON-parse failures showed only the raw parser message. Malformed parts are now dropped (with a toast reporting how many), successful imports report exact part/wire counts, and parse failures point at the likely cause (truncated paste / re-export) alongside the raw error.
- **Bulk board-changing actions (reset a proposal, re-place & route, cycle board type) gave no indication of what changed**, so a wrong click was hard to assess or recover from beyond blind trust in "元に戻す". They now report a concrete before/after diff (parts/wires moved or added/removed, or the resulting change in audit NG count) in the confirmation toast.
- **Board rendering: labels and wires could be hidden underneath opaque part bodies**, and dense boards showed no distinction between a covered pad and empty space. Part/pin labels now always paint after (on top of) pads, wire paths now paint after (on top of) part bodies instead of before, and wires using a very dark net color get a subtle white halo so they stay legible against dark IC bodies.
- **The pass banner ("組んで大丈夫です") didn't say what it does and doesn't check** — it reads only the automated ERC/EE audit, not physical realities like component orientation. Its text now says so explicitly. The empty-board state (no parts placed) previously showed a generic pass banner instead of guidance to get started.
- **`locked:true` parts (excluded from auto re-placement) had no visible indicator** beyond a small marker with no explanation, and toggling a lock didn't refresh the board legend. Lock markers now carry a tooltip explaining the contract, the legend shows a lock-usage row when any part is locked, and re-place/route results report how many locked parts were skipped.
- **The first-run welcome screen was a one-shot dialog** — dismiss it (by mistake or otherwise) and "start from a blank board" was gone for the rest of the session, along with the guide's board-type explanation. Added a permanent "新規（空の基板）" button and command-palette entry that does the same thing at any time.
- **Keyboard accessibility: board editing was pointer-only (zero keyboard paths, WCAG 2.1.1).** The SVG board is now a keyboard-operable composite widget (Tab into it, arrow keys cycle part selection, Shift+Arrow moves the selected part one grid hole using the same placement-validity checks as mouse drag). The welcome modal and command palette declared `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal` without actually trapping focus or restoring it on close — both now use a shared focus-trap helper. The guide panel's step text is now an `aria-live` region, and weight-slider inputs are correctly associated with their visible labels via `aria-labelledby`.
- **Toast notifications auto-dismissed on a fixed timer with no way to re-read one that scrolled past**, and the audit verdict banner wasn't exposed as a live region for screen readers. Toasts now pause on hover and can be dismissed by click; the last notification stays visible in the status bar; the 5 verdict-banner variants are `role="status"`.
- **Undo had no matching Redo** — an accidental `Ctrl+Z` had no way back except manually redoing the work. Added a symmetric redo stack, a "やり直す" button (`Ctrl+Y`/`Ctrl+Shift+Z`), and a command-palette entry.
- **The current edit mode (move/bridge/block/probe/cut) wasn't visible anywhere outside the toolbar buttons**, making it easy to lose track of which click-action was active. Added a status-bar chip showing the current mode and a matching cursor style per mode.
- **Two independent sources of truth for command names/keywords/keybindings** (the command palette's list and the mode-switch buttons/keydown handler) could drift out of sync. Consolidated into one `CMDS` registry that both derive from.
- **Adversarial review of the above fixes** (independent 4-dimension pass: state-mutation, new-feature correctness, render/a11y, i18n/parity — each finding cross-checked by a second skeptic before acceptance) caught two data-integrity blockers that shipped in earlier commits of this same body of work: `delProp()` (delete a proposal) remapped the undo stack's indices but not the newly-added redo stack, so deleting a proposal after an undo/redo sequence could crash on the next `Ctrl+Y` or silently overwrite an unrelated surviving proposal's content; and the external-power-terminal feature above registered into a global settings object keyed only against the *currently viewed* proposal, so simply switching to look at a different proposal (including the app's own second bundled sample) would silently and permanently un-register the terminal even though it was still sitting on the original board — quietly undoing the fix it shipped as. Also fixed: the guide panel wasn't included in the new keyboard-focus-trap work, so Tab could leak from a guided walkthrough onto the live board and the new arrow-key nudge could edit it invisibly under the guide's overlay; a "new blank board" action left a permanent no-op undo entry that never got cleaned up by `Ctrl+Z`; and a duplicate i18n dictionary key silently broke the English-locale guide's first-step label. (All parity-safe — no `ee`/ERC/`solver.py`/parity-path change; confirmed via byte-identical gate output before/after.)

- **Smaller polish**: the zoom buttons now clarify they scale only the board diagram, not on-screen text size (browser Ctrl+/Ctrl- does that); a duplicate i18n dictionary key and 5 hardcoded-English `aria-label`s were closed; the two bundled sample proposals' names now route through the same translation path as everything else instead of being hardcoded English; the welcome screen and share-link toast wording were rewritten to lead with what the reader actually needs to know; "進め方" (an ambiguous label shared by two different UI sections) was renamed to "ショートカット" in the one that means keyboard shortcuts; the primary-button gradient's dark stop was darkened to meet WCAG AA contrast (was 3.69:1, now 4.83:1); and `scrollIntoView`/`scrollTo` calls now respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Added
- **Proposal provenance and lifecycle.** Each proposal now tracks where it came from (verified/sample/solver/shared/import/blank/saved) and whether it's been edited since, shown as a badge; proposals can be renamed and deleted (with confirmation) from the sidebar.

## [0.6.9] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **3D isometric view (view-only)** — a "3D" toggle next to the back-view button shows the board from a fixed dimetric (yaw 45°/pitch 30°) angle on a new `<canvas id="pw-iso">`, rendered entirely independently of the existing 2D SVG editor (which is unchanged and remains the only way to edit). Component bodies (elec/disc/film/r/ic) reuse the same shading language as the existing part-preview panel (`PHYS_PREVIEW`), extended to full-board world coordinates via a new `ISO_DRAW` dispatch table. Click to select (synced with the 2D selection/lock state), drag to pan, Ctrl+wheel to zoom, hover a legend row to dim other nets — all read/write the same `selPart`/`selSet`/`hoverNet` globals the 2D view uses, so switching between 2D and 3D never loses your place. Editing (drag, bridge/block/probe/cut modes, lock/delete keys) is disabled in 3D by design; switching to any edit action returns to 2D automatically. The design (projection formulas, depth-sort strategy, bake/cache layering, performance budget) went through a research + adversarial-review pass before implementation; the review caught and the implementation fixes several correctness issues that would otherwise have shipped (wires crossing over an IC being hidden underneath it instead of drawn on top; click targets going stale after panning; a devicePixelRatio double-scaling bug on HiDPI displays; a wheel-zoom event leaking into the 2D view's zoom state). Known v1 limitation, called out in code comments: two components placed immediately adjacent to each other (e.g. a decoupling capacitor next to an IC) can occasionally sort into the wrong front/back order — a rare, cosmetic-only artifact of using a simple depth key rather than full visibility ordering. (Rendering-only; reads board state, writes only selection/hover — no `ee`/ERC/`solver.py`/parity-path change.)

## [0.6.8] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Launch-readiness pass**: a "Clear saved data" confirmation dialog (previously a single misclick silently wiped all local edits with no undo); the audit banner and its "総合" (overall) line no longer contradict each other (the banner could say "safe to solder, only a wire-length note" while a red NG line showed right below it — found by an adversarial usability + design-critique pass, not just code review); the audit panel is now a bordered card/row layout instead of one long `<br>`-joined text block; a new original example board, **Pico Plant Sitter** (a Raspberry Pi Pico plant-watering/monitoring board with a "Before" proposal carrying three real, solver-verified mistakes — reversed electrolytic polarity, a misplaced decoupling cap, an ungated 5V-into-GPIO clamp risk — and a clean "Recommended" proposal), replaces the previous default board shown on first open (which wasn't clean to publish as the cold-start default); the welcome screen gained a "start from a blank board" option that applies the beginner-recommended placement profile automatically.
- **CI**: `ci_smoke.py` now locks in the Pico Plant Sitter example's exact expected findings (2 hard NG + 1 warn on "Before", `fabReady:true` on "Recommended") so a future `solver.py` change can't silently break the demo.

### Fixed
- **IC/module bodies now render for named-pin and single-row/single-column parts** (they used to silently disappear). The editor's part-draw loop indexed pins by the literal keys `'1'`/`'2'` to decide orientation, so a part whose `pins` are keyed by NAME (`VCC`/`GND`/`SDA`/`GPIO18_SCK`/`E`-`B`-`C`/…) — how MCU dev-boards, sensor breakouts and connectors are naturally modeled — threw and **aborted the entire parts layer, leaving a board of just wires with no visible components** (while `solver.py` still reported `fabReady`). It now takes the first two pins by insertion order (pin-key-agnostic). Separately, a single-row / single-column multi-pin part (pin header / single-edge module) computed a **negative** body cross-dimension, emitted as a `<rect>` with negative width/height that SVG does not paint; the body thickness is now clamped to a visible minimum. Multi-row DIPs are unchanged and still render correctly in **both** landscape and portrait. Found by headless (Chrome `--dump-dom` + screenshot) rendering verification. (Rendering-only; parity-safe — no `ee`/ERC/`solver.py`/parity-path change.)

### Added
- **SKILL.md §4b "build-type physical-caution checklist"** — a part-triggered guidance table the agent must fold into the plain-language audit summary, because these recurring implementation pitfalls are not visible from board geometry / `ee` alone (even a clean `fabReady` board can omit them). Covers: inductive-load coils (relay/solenoid/motor → drive via transistor + **flyback diode with correct orientation** + **separate the switching return from signal/sensor ground at a single star point**); motor drivers / H-bridges (split VM vs logic supply, don't float nSLEEP/EN, star ground); RF / solar / outdoor power (**reverse-flow/reverse-polarity Schottky with correct orientation**, **antenna/RF keep-away**, supply decoupling); **SSR/relay switching AC mains** (refuse the mains layout + redirect to a certified isolated module, and warn that an **SSR still leaks when commanded off so the load stays partly live** — kill power at the breaker before servicing); Li-ion/LiPo charging (charge-management IC required, electrolytic polarity); 5V-sensor-into-3.3V-GPIO (never direct — divider/level-shifter, and correct the user if they assume direct is fine). All advisory; never claim a board is safe to power. (Parity-safe: docs-only, no change to `ee`/ERC math, `solver.py`, or the parity paths.)

## [0.6.7] — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Plugin-consume robustness — the bundled skill now works when perfwire is installed as a Claude Code plugin** (cwd = the user's own project, scripts in `~/.claude/plugins/cache/…`), not only in the clone-and-open path. `SKILL.md` previously invoked `solver.py` / `tools/*.py` / `config.example.json` / `index.html` by bare cwd-relative paths, which fail for an installed-plugin consumer (`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is **not** exported to the Bash tool — only inline-substituted in manifests/hooks). SKILL.md now has a "前提: PLUGIN_ROOT" step that discovers the plugin root (newest installed version by mtime, `.in_use`-preferred, with a clone-and-open fallback and an actionable "not installed" message) and drives every bundled call through an absolute path.
- **A degraded EE audit no longer reports `fabReady: true`.** When no config is loaded (genuinely missing / mistyped `--config`), the core EE checks run empty; the solver now sets `ee.degraded: true` and forces `ee.fabReady: false` (and `stats.fabReady`), so an agent cannot tell a beginner "safe to solder" on an unaudited board. The `DEGRADED` stderr warning is unchanged; SKILL.md §4 instructs the agent to distrust `fabReady` when degraded. (Parity-safe: the browser always carries a populated config, so this only affects the config-less CLI path.)
- **`tools/make_link.py` / `tools/read_link.py` force UTF-8 stdout**, so a piped/redirected deep-link or state JSON is not mangled under a non-UTF-8 Windows locale.

### Added
- **CI gate #7 `tools/consume_smoke.py`** — copies the bundled payload to a throwaway "cache" dir outside the repo, runs the documented commands from a separate "consumer" cwd by absolute path, and asserts wires>0, a non-degraded audit, `--config` parity, and a deep-link round-trip. It also lints `SKILL.md` so a bundled-script invocation can never regress to the cwd-relative form.

### Notes
- `README.md` plugin section clarifies that the marketplace/plugin path needs repo **read access** (the repo is private), that third-party marketplaces don't auto-update (the install block always runs `/plugin marketplace update perfwire`), and adds a Windows `python3`-stub / "can't open solver.py" troubleshooting note.

## [0.6.6] — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Non-isolated board topologies — `grid.type` now models the board's own copper.**
  perfwire previously assumed isolated pads (`perf`) or strips (`strip`). A real
  failure — a board that "won't power on" because it was built on a **十字配線
  (cross-wired) universal board** whose every hole is bonded to its 4 neighbors —
  exposed the gap: the substrate shorted V3V3 to GND (and every other net) and the
  isolated-pad model could not see it. The stripboard segment primitive is
  generalized into one `board_links` / `boardLinks` generator that feeds the **same**
  ERC union-find, so a design routed assuming isolation is caught by `netMerge`
  (hard NG) when the board copper shorts its nets. New `grid.type` values:
  `mesh` (十字/格子, ships as one net — cut to isolate), `breadboard` (column
  segments + power-rail strips), `cluster` (2/3連ランド bonded groups), and
  `custom` (explicit `boardLinks` edge list). `perf`/`strip` unchanged.
- **Editor support for cross-wired boards.** The board-type command cycles
  `perf → strip → mesh → breadboard → cluster`; the renderer draws the intrinsic
  copper bridges (and cut marks); **cut mode (key 6)** now toggles a cut on any of
  the 4 mesh edges (not just the strip axis); and a new command
  **auto-generates the required-cut list** that isolates every net (region-grow,
  cut the boundaries) — applied to the board, written to the export box, and
  downloaded as a `.md` checklist for cutting the physical board.

### Fixed
- The strip-only ERC union block and render path are now general (`board_links`
  dispatch); `stripShorts` is still emitted for the segment-bounded types
  (`strip`/`breadboard`/`cluster`) and the whole-mesh case rides on `netMerge`.

## [0.6.5] — 2026-06-19

### Added
- **`bridgeDangle` (HARD NG) — a wire endpoint whose solder-bridge points at a
  hole that is anchored to nothing.** The connectivity solver unconditionally
  trusts a wire endpoint's `bridgeTo` (it unions the landing hole with the bridge
  target), so a wire shifted one hole onto an empty cell with a bridge to a
  dead hole still reports `openNets: []` — a silent open the existing checks miss.
  `bridgeDangle` flags an endpoint when its `bridgeTo` target is **not** anchored
  by any of: a part lead, the endpoint's own tap pad, a `padBridge`, or another
  wire endpoint landing there. The normal "land adjacent + bridge to the pad"
  idiom (used by ~95% of endpoints on a real board) is always anchored, so it
  does not fire — only a genuinely dangling bridge does. Mirrored byte-for-byte
  in `solver.py` and `index.html`; wiring-dependent (skipped on the synthetic
  parity fixtures, asserted empty on the bundled samples).

### Fixed
- `netMerge` (galvanic cross-net short) and the new `bridgeDangle` are now both
  counted by `ercHardCount()` and reflected in `#eedump`/`auditState`, so the
  editor verdict treats them as the hard NGs they are (previously `netMerge`
  reached the verdict only via the aggregate NG count, not `auditState`).

## [0.6.4] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Non-finite resistor `value` (Infinity/NaN)** is no longer echoed into the
  solver's `out.json` as a bare `Infinity` token (invalid JSON that would crash a
  downstream `JSON.parse`). It is coerced to `null` at intake and treated as
  "unspecified" by every rail-leak check; the JS engine adds an `isFinite()` guard
  so both engines exclude non-finite values identically.
- **A 0-ohm part** (`kind:"r", value:0`) modeled as a component rather than a
  jumper previously fell through *all* rail-leak checks. A 0-ohm resistor is a
  galvanic jumper, so `netMerge`'s union-find now unions the two lead holes of any
  2-lead `value:0` part — a 0-ohm part bridging two distinct nets now correctly
  fires `netMerge` (hard short). Mirrored in both engines.

## [0.6.3] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **`railReff` (WARN) — full-network rail-to-rail effective short.** Computes the
  effective resistance `R_eff` of the resistor network between each pair of power
  rails and warns when `I = |ΔV|/R_eff` exceeds `rail_short_ma` (default 50). This
  catches what per-resistor `railShort` structurally misses: **series chains**
  (22+22Ω = 44Ω = 75 mA), **parallel** low-R paths (120∥120 = 60Ω = 55 mA, where
  each branch alone is 27.5 mA = ok), and arbitrary **meshes** (Wheatstone
  bridges). `R_eff` is solved by a reduced nodal Laplacian via no-pivot Gaussian
  elimination over a sorted node index — the grounded Laplacian of a connected
  resistor net is SPD, so no-pivot elimination is stable *and* bit-deterministic.
  With fixed node/edge/summation order and no FMA, the float solve is
  **byte-identical across the JS and Python engines** (the gate also compares only
  `{pair, ok}`, as for `railShort`). Per-pair de-dup defers single direct resistors
  to `railShort`; reuses `rail_short_ma` (no new config); WARN-only (`fabReady`
  unchanged). Designed via a parity-feasibility workflow and passed a 3-angle
  adversarial audit (R_eff verified vs hand-computed values incl. an unbalanced
  bridge = 17000/71).

### Fixed
- `topology_audit` return-rail (GND) selection: the JS engine now breaks ties by
  lexicographically-smallest net name, matching Python's `min((rank, name))`, so a
  future multi-rank-0 power config (e.g. AGND + DGND) cannot diverge between engines.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-06-18

### Added — effective-short ERC checks
Three netlist checks for "current concentrating into an effective short" (no
hard solder bridge required), plus an analog-reference grounding refinement:

- **`netMerge` (HARD NG)** — two distinct intended nets joined into one galvanic
  node: a real short that was undetected on perfboards (`stripShorts` only
  covered strip boards; `openNets` is the inverse — one net split). Catches
  bridge/wire merges *and* same-hole multi-net shorts (per-hole net set, since
  `node_net` is last-write-wins). Editor-path by design — the solver re-routes
  per-net and never emits a merge — so it is `WIRING_DEP` in parity like `openNets`.
- **`railShort` (WARN)** — a resistor bridging two rails that draws excess
  quiescent current (`I = |ΔV|/R > rail_short_ma`, default 50 mA): an effective
  partial short *even when it stays under its power rating* (the gap
  `resistorPower` misses). Per-resistor v1; full-network R_eff / series chains
  are deferred to keep cross-engine float parity stable.
- **Reference-rail grounding** — the star/daisy return-topology analysis now also
  evaluates internal reference rails that have no external feed (new optional
  config `reference_rails`, e.g. `VMID` rooted at its bypass cap), flagging a
  daisy-chained analog mid-rail (common-impedance coupling). Return-topology
  depth now counts **component-lead hops**, not routing-hole hops, so a
  board-spanning but electrically-star rail no longer false-reads as daisy.

All WARN-level checks leave `fabReady` unchanged; `netMerge` is the only hard NG.
Each ships a byte-for-byte `solver.py` / `index.html` mirror, parity coverage,
and passed an adversarial audit loop. The CLI `ee.fixes` list now also covers
`clampRisk` / `netMerge` / `railShort`.

[0.6.2]: https://github.com/YusukeAraiKecku/perfwire/releases/tag/v0.6.2

## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **`clampRisk` ERC — input ESD-clamp / latch-up risk** (warn-level). For each IC
  input pin (`role=in`), it walks cap-coupled (non-resistive) net adjacency; if an
  external I/O terminal (`single_lead_allowlist`) is reachable **without a series
  resistor**, it flags `{pin, net, via}`. An off-board signal that can exceed the IC
  rails `[Vss,Vdd]` would conduct the input ESD/clamp diode (effective short /
  latch-up); a series R limits that current. Nets driven on-board by an op-amp output
  (`out`/`pwr_out`, via caps) are rail-bounded and **excluded**, so a board *output*
  (e.g. `IF_MIC`) is not a false aggressor. Reuses `pinTypes` / `single_lead_allowlist`
  — **no new config**; summed into `ee_warn`, never `ee_ng`, so **fabReady is
  unaffected**. solver.py + byte-for-byte index.html mirror; covered by
  `parity_check.mjs` (FIELDS + MUST_COVER) and `ci_smoke.py`. v1 limits (documented):
  only `kind==r` blocks the path; resistor value is ignored.

[0.6.1]: https://github.com/YusukeAraiKecku/perfwire/releases/tag/v0.6.1

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-15

A large editor/UX + component-model release focused on beginner usability and the
human ⇄ Claude Code loop. No EE-audit or solver math changed — JS↔Python parity stays
byte-for-byte across the whole release.

### Editing & interaction (direct manipulation)
- **Modeless "選択／移動"**: one tool grabs parts *and* terminals (wire ends / leads) by
  priority — no more switching between 端子/部品 modes to move different things.
- **Multi-select + group move**: Shift+click toggles, drag empty space box-selects, and
  dragging the selection moves it together (locked parts skipped).
- **On-board action bar + keys**: when something is selected, an action bar over the board
  shows "N個 選択中 · うちM個ロック" with Lock / Delete / Deselect; keys **L / Delete / Esc**
  do the same — no left-panel trips. Lock is the human↔AI "settled vs open" signal:
  `--propose` only re-places still-unlocked parts.
- **Side panel reordered** by what a beginner needs first (live audit → placement goal →
  legend on top; expert tools collapsed).
- **Confirmations are a visible toast** over the board instead of being buried in a panel.
- **Per-part dimensions in a selection-driven inspector** that scales to any number of
  parts/types (replaces the flat per-instance slider list).

### Component model & previews
- **Open component model**: `kind` is a geometric primitive, not a closed parts list —
  a **Raspberry Pi Pico, relay, connector, header** is modeled as `ic`; an **inductor /
  buzzer** as `r`/`disc`. An optional per-part `family` names it in the BOM & legend.
- **Data-driven 2.5D preview** for every kind (electrolytic can, ceramic disc, film box,
  resistor, IC/DIP footprint) — adding a kind is one table entry, no hardcoding.
- **Placement goals (plain-language methodology presets)**: Easy to build / Analog /
  Compact, shared by the editor dropdown and `solver.py --profile`.

### External connections
- **Off-board connections are now visualised**: external terminals (`W.*`) and single-lead
  audio-style **speaker / mic** I/O points get a boundary glyph (square tag + off-board arrow)
  and an "外部接続" legend that names *what* each connects to (Speaker / Mic / Power) and *where*.

### Config, provenance & Claude Code integration
- **Single config SSOT** (`config.example.json`) with a never-silent "EE audit degraded"
  warning; **one CI-verified dimension citation** (collapsed the old PHYSREF / physical_sources).
- **Round-trip handback**: `tools/read_link.py` (inverse of `make_link.py`) + a deep-link
  **Claude Code bar** (`make_link.py --task`) so the human ⇄ agent loop is self-explanatory.

### Fixes & hardening
- Adversarial-audit fixes for the dimension inspector + preview; load-time migration that
  strips stale per-instance resistor dims; legible standing resistors with cited dimensions.
