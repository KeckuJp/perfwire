# Changelog

## [0.6.3] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **`railReff` (WARN) — full-network rail-to-rail effective short.** Computes the
  effective resistance `R_eff` of the resistor network between each pair of power
  rails and warns when `I = |ΔV|/R_eff` exceeds `rail_short_ma` (default 50). This
  catches what per-resistor `railShort` structurally misses: **series chains**
  (22+22Ω = 44Ω = 75 mA), **parallel** low-R paths (120∥120 = 60Ω = 55 mA, where
  each branch alone is 27.5 mA = ok), and arbitrary **meshes** (Wheatstone
  bridges). `R_eff` is solved by a reduced nodal Laplacian via no-pivot Gaussian
  elimination over a sorted node index — the grounded Laplacian of a connected
  resistor net is SPD, so no-pivot elimination is stable *and* bit-deterministic.
  With fixed node/edge/summation order and no FMA, the float solve is
  **byte-identical across the JS and Python engines** (the gate also compares only
  `{pair, ok}`, as for `railShort`). Per-pair de-dup defers single direct resistors
  to `railShort`; reuses `rail_short_ma` (no new config); WARN-only (`fabReady`
  unchanged). Designed via a parity-feasibility workflow and passed a 3-angle
  adversarial audit (R_eff verified vs hand-computed values incl. an unbalanced
  bridge = 17000/71).

### Fixed
- `topology_audit` return-rail (GND) selection: the JS engine now breaks ties by
  lexicographically-smallest net name, matching Python's `min((rank, name))`, so a
  future multi-rank-0 power config (e.g. AGND + DGND) cannot diverge between engines.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-06-18

### Added — effective-short ERC checks
Three netlist checks for "current concentrating into an effective short" (no
hard solder bridge required), plus an analog-reference grounding refinement:

- **`netMerge` (HARD NG)** — two distinct intended nets joined into one galvanic
  node: a real short that was undetected on perfboards (`stripShorts` only
  covered strip boards; `openNets` is the inverse — one net split). Catches
  bridge/wire merges *and* same-hole multi-net shorts (per-hole net set, since
  `node_net` is last-write-wins). Editor-path by design — the solver re-routes
  per-net and never emits a merge — so it is `WIRING_DEP` in parity like `openNets`.
- **`railShort` (WARN)** — a resistor bridging two rails that draws excess
  quiescent current (`I = |ΔV|/R > rail_short_ma`, default 50 mA): an effective
  partial short *even when it stays under its power rating* (the gap
  `resistorPower` misses). Per-resistor v1; full-network R_eff / series chains
  are deferred to keep cross-engine float parity stable.
- **Reference-rail grounding** — the star/daisy return-topology analysis now also
  evaluates internal reference rails that have no external feed (new optional
  config `reference_rails`, e.g. `VMID` rooted at its bypass cap), flagging a
  daisy-chained analog mid-rail (common-impedance coupling). Return-topology
  depth now counts **component-lead hops**, not routing-hole hops, so a
  board-spanning but electrically-star rail no longer false-reads as daisy.

All WARN-level checks leave `fabReady` unchanged; `netMerge` is the only hard NG.
Each ships a byte-for-byte `solver.py` / `index.html` mirror, parity coverage,
and passed an adversarial audit loop. The CLI `ee.fixes` list now also covers
`clampRisk` / `netMerge` / `railShort`.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **`clampRisk` ERC — input ESD-clamp / latch-up risk** (warn-level). For each IC
  input pin (`role=in`), it walks cap-coupled (non-resistive) net adjacency; if an
  external I/O terminal (`single_lead_allowlist`) is reachable **without a series
  resistor**, it flags `{pin, net, via}`. An off-board signal that can exceed the IC
  rails `[Vss,Vdd]` would conduct the input ESD/clamp diode (effective short /
  latch-up); a series R limits that current. Nets driven on-board by an op-amp output
  (`out`/`pwr_out`, via caps) are rail-bounded and **excluded**, so a board *output*
  (e.g. `IF_MIC`) is not a false aggressor. Reuses `pinTypes` / `single_lead_allowlist`
  — **no new config**; summed into `ee_warn`, never `ee_ng`, so **fabReady is
  unaffected**. solver.py + byte-for-byte index.html mirror; covered by
  `parity_check.mjs` (FIELDS + MUST_COVER) and `ci_smoke.py`. v1 limits (documented):
  only `kind==r` blocks the path; resistor value is ignored.

[0.6.1]: https://github.com/YusukeAraiKecku/perfwire/releases/tag/v0.6.1

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-15

A large editor/UX + component-model release focused on beginner usability and the
human ⇄ Claude Code loop. No EE-audit or solver math changed — JS↔Python parity stays
byte-for-byte across the whole release.

### Editing & interaction (direct manipulation)
- **Modeless "選択／移動"**: one tool grabs parts *and* terminals (wire ends / leads) by
  priority — no more switching between 端子/部品 modes to move different things.
- **Multi-select + group move**: Shift+click toggles, drag empty space box-selects, and
  dragging the selection moves it together (locked parts skipped).
- **On-board action bar + keys**: when something is selected, an action bar over the board
  shows "N個 選択中 · うちM個ロック" with Lock / Delete / Deselect; keys **L / Delete / Esc**
  do the same — no left-panel trips. Lock is the human↔AI "settled vs open" signal:
  `--propose` only re-places still-unlocked parts.
- **Side panel reordered** by what a beginner needs first (live audit → placement goal →
  legend on top; expert tools collapsed).
- **Confirmations are a visible toast** over the board instead of being buried in a panel.
- **Per-part dimensions in a selection-driven inspector** that scales to any number of
  parts/types (replaces the flat per-instance slider list).

### Component model & previews
- **Open component model**: `kind` is a geometric primitive, not a closed parts list —
  a **Raspberry Pi Pico, relay, connector, header** is modeled as `ic`; an **inductor /
  buzzer** as `r`/`disc`. An optional per-part `family` names it in the BOM & legend.
- **Data-driven 2.5D preview** for every kind (electrolytic can, ceramic disc, film box,
  resistor, IC/DIP footprint) — adding a kind is one table entry, no hardcoding.
- **Placement goals (plain-language methodology presets)**: Easy to build / Analog /
  Compact, shared by the editor dropdown and `solver.py --profile`.

### External connections
- **Off-board connections are now visualised**: external terminals (`W.*`) and the client-hardware
  **speaker / mic** I/O points get a boundary glyph (square tag + off-board arrow) and an
  "外部接続" legend that names *what* each connects to (Speaker / Mic / Power) and *where*.

### Config, provenance & Claude Code integration
- **Single config SSOT** (`config.example.json`) with a never-silent "EE audit degraded"
  warning; **one CI-verified dimension citation** (collapsed the old PHYSREF / physical_sources).
- **Round-trip handback**: `tools/read_link.py` (inverse of `make_link.py`) + a deep-link
  **Claude Code bar** (`make_link.py --task`) so the human ⇄ agent loop is self-explanatory.

### Fixes & hardening
- Adversarial-audit fixes for the dimension inspector + preview; load-time migration that
  strips stale per-instance resistor dims; legible standing resistors with cited dimensions.
